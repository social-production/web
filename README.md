# 🌱 Social Production

A community platform for organising collective projects, pooling resources, and building things together — neighbourhood by neighbourhood.

Think Reddit meets a cooperative organiser: people post project ideas, recruit members, schedule meetups, and collectively fund shared goals.

---

## What is this?

Social Production is built around the idea that communities can produce things together — gardens, tool libraries, murals, classes, housing campaigns — when they have the right tools to coordinate.

The platform lets users:

- **Post projects** with status tracking (Proposed → Active → Completed)
- **Post threads** for discussion and debate
- **Join projects** and collaborate with members
- **Schedule meetups** — in-person or online
- **Collectively fundraise** toward shared goals
- **Subscribe to channels** organised by topic or geography (e.g. Brooklyn, Food & Agriculture, Housing)
- **Follow updates** as projects evolve

## Current State (Frontend)

The frontend is fully built as a working prototype with mock data. All pages are navigable and interactive.

| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| `/` | Main feed — filter, sort, vote on posts |
| `/post/:id` | Full post view with comments, meetups, funding widget, updates feed |
| `/create` | Create a thread or project (with meetup scheduling + funding form) |
| `/edit-project/:id` | Edit an existing project |
| `/channel/:name` | Channel page with filtered feed |
| `/create-channel` | Create a new community channel |
| `/user/:username` | User profile with threads, projects, comments tabs |
| `/auth` | Login / signup forms |

**No backend yet** — all data is mock data in `src/data.js`. Backend integration (PostgreSQL + Docker) is in active development.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend (current)**
- **React 18** with hooks
- **Vite** for dev server and bundling
- **React Router v6** for client-side routing
- All styling is inline CSS (no CSS framework)
- **PWA support** via `vite-plugin-pwa` — installable on iOS and Android from the browser

**Backend (in development)**
- **PostgreSQL** — direct, no third-party wrappers
- **Docker** — containerized for easy self-hosting
- **REST API** — connecting frontend to persistent data

## Architecture & Hosting Philosophy

Social Production is designed to be **self-hosted and community-owned** — no dependency on any third-party service or corporation.

- **Self-hostable:** The backend is a Docker container. Any community can run their own instance on their own server with a single command.
- **No lock-in:** Direct PostgreSQL — no proprietary wrappers, no vendor dependency.
- **Federated (long-term goal):** Communities run local nodes (e.g. a Brooklyn node, a London node) that connect to the wider network. Users have a home node but can interact across the whole platform — post to any channel, join any project, move between nodes if they relocate. Local roots, global network.
- **Open source (AGPL-3.0):** The code is public and forkable. Corporations cannot take it, close it, and profit from it.
